            <p>You and me, we used to be together
                Every day together, always
                I really feel that I'm losin' my best friend
                I can't believe this could be the end
                It looks as though you're lettin' go
                And if it's real, well, I don't want to know
                … Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin'
                So please stop explainin'
                Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
                Don't speak, I know what you're thinkin'
                I don't need your reasons
                Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
                … Our memories, well, they can be inviting
                But some are altogether mighty frightening
                As we die, both you and I
                With my head in my hands, I sit and cry
                … Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin'
                So please stop explainin'
                Don't tell me 'cause it hurts, no, no, no
                Don't speak, I know what you're thinkin'
                And I don't need your reasons
                Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
                … It's all ending
                We gotta stop pretending
                Who we are
                … You and me
                I can see us dyin'
                Aren't we?
                … Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin'
                So please stop explainin'
                Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
                No, no, don't speak, I know what you're thinkin'
                And I don't need your reasons
                Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
                … Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
                I know what you're sayin'
                So please stop explainin'
                Don't speak, don't speak
                Don't speak, no
                I know what you're thinkin'
                And I don't need your reasons
                I know you're good, I know you're good
                I know you're real good, oh
                La, la, la, la
                La, la, la, la
                Don't, don't, ooh, ooh
                Hush, hush, darling
                Hush, hush, darling
                Hush, hush
                Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
                Hush, hush, darling
                Hush, hush, darling
                Hush, hush
                Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
                Oh, hush, hush, darling
                Hush, hush, darling
